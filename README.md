(there are more screenshots and a breakdown of the UI components in the forum post, I'll refrain from crossposting them here because they would take up a lot of space and what's here already is enough to give you an idea of what's going on)

## Installation
Check out the [Mod Market post](https://www.rebornevo.com/forums/topic/53413-minimalist-indicators-v100-e1841/) I made for the mod on the Reborn forums, it includes instructions for installation.

The thread itself will also be the best way to contact me about the mod for any questions or issues you encounter, and if you do have an issue it may have already been discussed there.

## Credits
I just wanted to thank [Waynolt](https://www.rebornevo.com/forum/index.php?/profile/71186-waynolt/) for their work on SWM, their scripts for ShowStatBoosts and TypeBattleIcons were very helpful as a jumping-off point for my own code since I was unfamiliar with the inner workings of Essentials scripting and with Ruby in general. (They also said I didn't even have to credit them, what a legend)

Also, thanks to [Ame](https://www.rebornevo.com/forum/index.php?/profile/1-amethyst/) and the rest of the Reborn team for the amazing game; you guys put in a lot of heart and I'm looking forward to the full release!
