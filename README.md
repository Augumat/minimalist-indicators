## Credits
I just wanted to thank [https://www.rebornevo.com/forum/index.php?/profile/71186-waynolt/](Waynolt) for their work on SWM, their scripts for ShowStatBoosts and TypeBattleIcons were very helpful as a jumping-off point for my own code. (They also said I didn't even have to credit them, what a legend)

Also, thanks to [Ame](https://www.rebornevo.com/forum/index.php?/profile/1-amethyst/) for the amazing game; I've enjoyed every playthrough and I look forward to the full release so I can start over again haha.
